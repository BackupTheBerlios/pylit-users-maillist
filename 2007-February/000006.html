Nice to hear from you again.

</I>...

&gt;<i> &gt; If we want to keep the line numbers in sync for text and code source, the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as the first header line. Therfore, header lines could not be marked as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; literal block (this would require the &quot;::&quot; and an empty line above the code).
</I>
&gt;<i> Mapping the file header as a comment is ok IMHO; indeed, keeping the
</I>&gt;<i> line numbers in sync for text and code source can be a great aid when
</I>&gt;<i> debugging L.P. code.
</I>
(And vital for the --doctest option that works on the text-source. This
is why I removed the removal of lonely ``::``-s from the code source.)

&gt;<i> (And I see from the source that there might be an option in the future
</I>&gt;<i> to map the header to a user-specified reST directive.)
</I>
(Which will make the indentation issue more complicated, as with a
configurable `header_prefix` attribute, the additional indent of the
first line is not always 2 but len(header_prefix).

The nice thing is, that a directive allows text starting on the same line
as well.

&gt;<i> &gt; - it may come as surprise if a part of the file is not &quot;printed&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - one more syntax element to learn for rst newbees to start with pylit,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (however, starting from the code source, this will be auto-generated)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the case that there is no matching comment at all, the complete code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source will become a comment -- however, in this case it is not very likely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the source is a literate document.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>
&gt;<i> Hmm, this already fooled me on the very first example I tried: 
</I>
Sorry for this. I plan to extend the tutorial to cover the case of
&quot;attached&quot; or &quot;minor&quot; comments. 

So, actually, a PyLit novice needs to know at least three rst syntax
elements:

* literal blocks
* comment (for the header)
* paragraph separator (blank line) (i.e. whitespace only: &quot;^[ \t]*$&quot;)

&gt;<i> I started by drafting some Python code and then trying to use PyLit to
</I>&gt;<i> turn it into a reST document for adding L.P. documentation.
</I>
This is how I imagine the &quot;normal&quot; use of pylit.

&gt;<i> Although this might justly regarded as a corner case, it may confuse
</I>&gt;<i> novices (like I am); it should be clearly stated in the documentation
</I>&gt;<i> that a documentation paragraph should *separate* the header from the
</I>&gt;<i> code (meaning, there should be a block, preceded and followed by an
</I>&gt;<i> empty line, all whose lines match the doc comment string).
</I>
Actually, the case to be documented is the separation of text and code
blocks (or chunks or paragraphs). The leading code block to become a
header (and rst comment) is just a special case but the logic to separate
it from a text block is the same as further down.

As said above, I plan to spent a section in the tutorial on this example.
May I copy your example to the tutorial? (And the
99bottles.py to the examples?)

&gt;<i> &gt; (I do not really like the additional indent of the first line, however
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ``..#! /usr/bin/env python`` would not be treated as comment by docutils.
</I>
&gt;<i> PyLit could add two spaces &quot;  &quot; to all the lines in the header except the
</I>&gt;<i> first one (in code2txt), and remove them in txt2code; this would align
</I>&gt;<i> all lines in the converted header, while maintaing the comment block
</I>&gt;<i> within correct reST syntax.
</I>
Unfortunately, this would only move the problem further down. As (in
order to satisfy the Python &quot;indentation consistency&quot; requirement) PyLit
will use the indentation of the first &quot;code&quot; line as base for all code
line indents, it is at least as strange to see::

  ..  #!/usr/bin/env python
      #
      # 99bottles.py -- print the famous &quot;99 bottles of beer&quot; song lyrics
      # 
     
  This is an introductory example to literate programming::

    # count down from 99 to 1
    for bottles in range(99,0,-1):
        ....
  
with the inconsistency between the two first code blocks as it is to see::

  ..  #!/usr/bin/env python
    #
    # 99bottles.py -- print the famous &quot;99 bottles of beer&quot; song lyrics
    #
     
  This is an introductory example to literate programming::

    # count down from 99 to 1
    for bottles in range(99,0,-1):
        ....

with the inconsistent indent confined to the very first line. Actually, I
find the latter even less intrusive.

This becomes really an issue with e.g.::

  .. pylit_header:: #!/usr/bin/env python
                    #
                    # 99bottles.py -- print the famous &quot;99 bottles of beer&quot; song lyrics
                    #


Thanks
