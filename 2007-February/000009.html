&gt;<i> Dear G&#252;enter,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> here's a proposal to change the blank line handling in PyLit, that, I
</I>&gt;<i> think, could lead to considerable simplification of the code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Present PyLit behavior: if a blank line occurs between two
</I>&gt;<i> text/documentation blocks, then the two blocks are merged into one::
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   [a.py]                  [a.py.txt]                 [a.py]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   # Text1                 Text1                      # Text1
</I>&gt;<i>           == pylit -c ==&gt;           == pylit -t ==&gt;  #       &lt;-- !!
</I>&gt;<i>   # Text2                 Text2                      # Text2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion is: blank lines always stay blank, they are not changed
</I>&gt;<i> by PyLit.
</I>
There is one problem here: the code -&gt; text conversion looses information
about whether a blank line was commented or not! I.e. there is no way to
do a distinction between your example and

  # Text1                 Text1                      # Text1
  #       == pylit -c ==&gt;           == pylit -t ==&gt;  #       &lt;-- :-)
  # Text2                 Text2                      # Text2


(Thus, I have to admit that the statement &quot;both formats of the source
hold the full information&quot; is not completely true -- at least if you
regard commenting or not of blank lines as non redundant)


Now, we have to decide whether in text -&gt; code conversion blank lines
should have comments or not, the tested variants were:

* leave blank lines blank -&gt; converts commented-blank to blank

  + Text structure is clearly visible in the code source.
  
* comment all lines       -&gt; converts blank to commented blank

  + Text blocks are clearly marked as units that belong together.

* comment if line contains whitespace (other than \n)

  - hidden markup, bad idea

Looks like a matter of taste, so maybe one more option
&quot;--comment-blank-lines&quot;?

&gt;<i> This implies that
</I>
&gt;<i> 1) blank lines are used as *block separators*, and
</I>
&gt;<i> 2) PyLit operates at block level: in code2txt mode, a block is a
</I>&gt;<i> text/documentation block iff all lines begin with the 'comment_string',
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise it is a code block; in txt2code mode, a block is a code block
</I>&gt;<i> if it is indented and introduced by '::' (as per reST syntax),
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise it is a text block.
</I>
Actually, this works regardless of the &quot;--comment-blank-lines&quot; setting,
as the transition between code-block and text-block always requires a
non-commented blank line.[#]_

.. _[#] Currently, in Text2Code, if there is no blank line after a line
        ending with ``::``, it is inserted (together with a warning) but
        this &quot;fixing&quot; feature could also be dismissed.


&gt;<i> Implementing the above behavior is rather trivial for Code2Text: 
</I>
It wasn't &quot;trivial&quot; considering all the corner cases, but it is in the
new pylit.py version at SVN.

&gt;<i>   block = []
</I>&gt;<i>   for line in data:
</I>&gt;<i>       block.append(line)
</I>&gt;<i>       if line.strip():
</I>...

The collecting of lines and the state-test occure now in the __iter__
method.

&gt;<i>         # blank line encountered, output formatted block
</I>
This is done by the state functions::

          yield getattr(self, self.state)()

...
&gt;<i>           print line[len(comment_string):]
</I>
The state handlers do not `print` but return the list of lines.

This way:

* Iterating over a `Code2Text` instance yields a sequence of converted
  blocks (all with a trailing blank line).
  
  `Code2Text`.state can be checked to see whether the block is &quot;header&quot;,
  &quot;text&quot; or &quot;code&quot;.
  
* Calling an `Code2Text` instance calls `__call__` which returns a list
  of converted blocks.
  
  There is no way to tell wich blocks are text or code (short of a new
  parsing).
  
  (The `__call__` method is defined in the parent `Simplestates` class.
  It can easily be overwritten to include some input or output filters).
  
  Maybe it would be better if it returned a flat list of lines instead?

  
* ``str(Code2Text(data))`` calls the `__str__` method that returns the
  converted document as string.


Some things that made life complicated: 

* We still need to care for commented blank lines with comment string
  without trailing whitespace...

* One problem is the auto append of the code-block marker to the text
  block. IMO this is an important feature for conversion of &quot;still
  iliterate&quot; code to literate one. (Import of code files, so to say.)

* The `--strip` option: with the approach in version 0.2.8 it is always
  determined in which order the blocks are returned -- code and text blocks
  alternate.
  
  Now the strip option is catered for by conditionals again.

&gt;<i> Most important to me, this would let me throw away nearly half of the
</I>&gt;<i> code for the ELisp filters, and remove the need for the filter-to-core
</I>&gt;<i> signaling (the ugly '\x08'*4 lines...)
</I>
Could you explain your problem with the ELisp filters a bit more detailled?
Maybe we could find and define a convenient API (tentative first).

Thanks

G&#252;nter
