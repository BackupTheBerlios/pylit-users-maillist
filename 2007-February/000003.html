<PRE>Hello,

sorry for the long delay in answering - I've had a very busy week...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it would be nice to extend PyLit so that it can translate all

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; A criterion could be: everything from the start of the file to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; first blank line is turned into a reST comment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How about
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * any code that appears before the first text block is translated to a rst
</I>&gt;<i>   comment?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we want to keep the line numbers in sync for text and code source, the
</I>&gt;<i> reStructured Text markup for these header lines must start at the same line
</I>&gt;<i> as the first header line. Therfore, header lines could not be marked as
</I>&gt;<i> literal block (this would require the &quot;::&quot; and an empty line above the code).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Mapping the file header as a comment is ok IMHO; indeed, keeping the
line numbers in sync for text and code source can be a great aid when
debugging L.P. code.

(And I see from the source that there might be an option in the future
to map the header to a user-specified reST directive.)


&gt;<i> OTOH, a *comment* may start at the same line as the comment marker and it
</I>&gt;<i> includes subsequent indented lines. Comments are visible in the reStructured
</I>&gt;<i> Text source but hidden in the pretty-printed output.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With a header converted to comment in the text source, everything before the
</I>&gt;<i> first text block (i.e. before the first paragraph using the matching comment
</I>&gt;<i> string) will be hidden away (in HTML or PDF output).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems a good compromise, the advantages
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * line numbers are kept
</I>&gt;<i> * the &quot;normal&quot; code conversion rules (indent/unindent by `codeindent` apply
</I>&gt;<i> * greater flexibility: you can hide a repeating header in a project
</I>&gt;<i>   consisting of many source files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> set off the disadvantages
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - it may come as surprise if a part of the file is not &quot;printed&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> - one more syntax element to learn for rst newbees to start with pylit,
</I>&gt;<i>   (however, starting from the code source, this will be auto-generated)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case that there is no matching comment at all, the complete code
</I>&gt;<i> source will become a comment -- however, in this case it is not very likely
</I>&gt;<i> the source is a literate document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm, this already fooled me on the very first example I tried: I
started by drafting some Python code and then trying to use PyLit to
turn it into a reST document for adding L.P. documentation.

For instance::

  #!/usr/bin/env python
  #
  # 99bottles.py -- print the famous &quot;99 bottles of beer&quot; song lyrics
  #
  #
  # This is used as an introductory example to literate programming
  # in the literateprograms.org Wiki.

  # count down from 99 to 1
  for bottles in range(99,0,-1):
      ....

is mapped to reST::

  ..  #!/usr/bin/env python
    #
    # 99bottles.py -- print the famous &quot;99 bottles of beer&quot; song lyrics
    #
    # This is used as an introductory example to literate programming
    # in the literateprograms.org Wiki.
    #

    # count down from 99 to 1
    for bottles in range(99,0,-1):
        ....

that is, a whole comment paragraph, whereas the input *code source*::

  #!/usr/bin/env python
  #
  # 99bottles.py -- print the famous &quot;99 bottles of beer&quot; song lyrics
  #

  # This is used as an introductory example to literate programming
  # in the literateprograms.org Wiki.

  # count down from 99 to 1
  for bottles in range(99,0,-1):
      ....

is correctly mapped to reST::

  ..  #!/usr/bin/env python
    #
    # 99bottles.py -- print the famous &quot;99 bottles of beer&quot; song lyrics
    #

  This is used as an introductory example to literate programming
  in the literateprograms.org Wiki.

  ::

    # count down from 99 to 1
    for bottles in range(99,0,-1):
        ....

Although this might justly regarded as a corner case, it may confuse
novices (like I am); it should be clearly stated in the documentation
that a documentation paragraph should *separate* the header from the
code (meaning, there should be a block, preceded and followed by an
empty line, all whose lines match the doc comment string).

Could the state machine in PyLit be modified to allow three states,
&quot;header&quot; (H), &quot;code&quot; (C) and &quot;text&quot; (T), starting in &quot;header&quot; mode and
allowing transitions from H to C *or* T, from C to T and vice-versa,
but never from C/T to H?  Like this::

  +--- H ---+
  |         |
  v         v
  C &lt;-----&gt; T


&gt;<i> (I do not really like the additional indent of the first line, however
</I>&gt;<i> ``..#! /usr/bin/env python`` would not be treated as comment by docutils.
</I>&gt;<i> Increasing the indent of all code parts is possible but makes bad use of
</I>&gt;<i> available line space. And for Python users the problem is familiar from
</I>&gt;<i> long string literals like::
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   s = &quot;&quot;&quot;first line
</I>&gt;<i>   second line
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
PyLit could add two spaces &quot;  &quot; to all the lines in the header except the
first one (in code2txt), and remove them in txt2code; this would align
all lines in the converted header, while maintaing the comment block
within correct reST syntax.

Ciao,
Riccardo
