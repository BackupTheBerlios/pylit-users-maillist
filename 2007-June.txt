Dear G?nther,

the pylit_elisp.py that you sent me runs fine with pylit.py rev51,
with some minor quirks:

  - "elisp" is not defined as a language in the main PyLit, so I've
    added dynamical loading of languages, driven by the --language
    command-line option (patch attached)

    However, PyLit cannot guess the language from the file extension
    this way; one has to explicitly tell it: e.g. this will *not*
    work::

      pylit -c pylit.el

    Whereas this one will do::

      pylit --language=elisp -c pylit.el


  - code2text conversion runs fine; the other way round, though,
    comment line blocks are joined together.  For instance::

      ;; .. |elisp> ;;; Commentary:

      reST docs here...

    becomes:

      ;;; Commentary:
      ;;
      ;; reST docs here...

    To me, the simplest way out of this is for PyLit to pass blank
    lines through unchanged.  Since you already pointed out that this
    could lead to unqanted results when doing the other round-trip
    (text -> code -> text), maybe this could become a selectable user
    option?  (Should have language-dependent defaults, being "conserve
    blank lines" for ELisp, and the present behaviour for other
    languages.)

Other remarks on you proposal follow inline:

+1.  It is a very good idea!  It's simpler and much less hackish than
current system, however it forces on documentation same structure as
source file.  But I would go for it, anyway.

Two remarks:

1) Blocks of the form::

   /* some comments,
      even on more lines */

or::

   /* a comment,
    * on more than one line,
    * with asterisk prefixed. */

are commonplace in C source code - using them as documentation blocks
will render it difficult to convert existing C/C++ sources to
PyLit.

So I would suggest that doc blocks are marked in some special way.
Just like Doxygen uses "/**" and "/*!" as documentation markers,
I would suggest that PyLit uses "/*/"::

  /*/  This is a documentation
       block, that spans over
       many lines.
  /*/

  /* this is an ordinary C comment, it is treated like
     a code block by PyLit */

The "/*/" appears to be legal, I checked with GCC.


2) C++ code is likely to mix both forms of comments, so translating
/*-comments to //-comments will lead to breaking the bidirectionality
of PyLit.  I suggest using an "impossible" comment string (like
'\x08\x08') for converted /*-comments: actually, the converted
comments are only seen by PyLit's code and do never reach the output
file, so everything should be fine.

Or, one can abstract the filters a bit more, and have the pre- and
post-processor chain chew couples `(tag, line)` where `line` is the
line of input text (a string), and `tag` is one of None, "header",
"text", "code" - meaning that the line belongs to the file header, to
a text or code block, or that it has not been classified yet.
So, a filter could alter not just the line contents (like
pre-processors do now), but it can classify it.  So, within "/*/", the
C-block-comments preprocessor would return `("text", line)` for every
input line, and out of it would return `("code", line)` instead.  (I
hope I made myself clear - it's very late and I cannot mock up example
code right now.)

Should strip, like is done with every other form of doc comment.

C block comments cannot be nested.

I agree.
