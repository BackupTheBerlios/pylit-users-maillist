</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It seems to me that there is a general need for similar header

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; licence information at the start of the file, at a minimum.
</I>...

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it would be nice to extend PyLit so that it can translate all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the &quot;leading portion&quot; of a file to reST comments.
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A criterion could be: everything from the start of the file to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; first blank line is turned into a reST comment.
</I>
How about 

* any code that appears before the first text block is translated to a rst
  comment?

If we want to keep the line numbers in sync for text and code source, the
reStructured Text markup for these header lines must start at the same line
as the first header line. Therfore, header lines could not be marked as
literal block (this would require the &quot;::&quot; and an empty line above the code).

OTOH, a *comment* may start at the same line as the comment marker and it
includes subsequent indented lines. Comments are visible in the reStructured
Text source but hidden in the pretty-printed output.

With a header converted to comment in the text source, everything before the
first text block (i.e. before the first paragraph using the matching comment
string) will be hidden away (in HTML or PDF output). 

This seems a good compromise, the advantages

* line numbers are kept
* the &quot;normal&quot; code conversion rules (indent/unindent by `codeindent` apply
* greater flexibility: you can hide a repeating header in a project
  consisting of many source files.

set off the disadvantages

- it may come as surprise if a part of the file is not &quot;printed&quot;,
- one more syntax element to learn for rst newbees to start with pylit,
  (however, starting from the code source, this will be auto-generated)

In the case that there is no matching comment at all, the complete code
source will become a comment -- however, in this case it is not very likely
the source is a literate document.

If needed for the documentation, it is possible to repeat the header in (or
after) the first text block  

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For instance, Python code::
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  #! /usr/bin/env python
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  #
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  # foo -- a script to bar the baz's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  #
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  # Copyright (c) 2007 ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  #
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  # This starts the documentation comments,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  # as it occurs after a blank line.
</I>
This will still work with my proposition, as &quot;#!&quot; != &quot;# &quot; and hence the
leading block is recognized as code. It would become::

  .. #! /usr/bin/env python
    #
    # foo -- a script to bar the baz's
    #
    # Copyright (c) 2007 ...
    #

  This starts the documentation comments,
  as it occurs after a blank line.

(I do not really like the additional indent of the first line, however
``..#! /usr/bin/env python`` would not be treated as comment by docutils.
Increasing the indent of all code parts is possible but makes bad use of
available line space. And for Python users the problem is familiar from 
long string literals like::

  s = &quot;&quot;&quot;first line
  second line
  &quot;&quot;&quot;
)

&gt;<i> Yes, but consider this excerpt from ELisp package atom-blogger_ ::

</I>&gt;<i>    ...
</I>
&gt;<i> The file header contains information that is formatted for automatic
</I>&gt;<i> information retrieval and quite ugly for a human to look at, before
</I>&gt;<i> the (human readable and properly formatted) copyright and licence
</I>&gt;<i> text.
</I>...
&gt;<i> (The above example has an empty line in the middle of the
</I>&gt;<i> header/colophon, so the file would need to be reformatted anyway to
</I>&gt;<i> comply with the suggested PyLit coding convention.)
</I>
With the new proposion this would automatically work as expected.

If you wish an even more 'pretty printed' preface, the &quot;emacs compatible&quot;
one should still be &quot;hidden&quot; by filling the blank line with a comment and
an rst header (or colophon) added instead at a place of your choice.

The simple example ``hello.py``::
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   # A famous example code printing a friendly greeting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   print &quot;hello world&quot;
</I>
will now get an empty header, i.e. the text source becomes::

  A famous example code printing a friendly greeting

  ::

    print &quot;hello world&quot;

&gt;<i> I'm not sure I understand this directive proposal: are you suggesting
</I>&gt;<i> that text from the first comment block in the *code* source (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;from the start of the file up to the first blank line) is wrapped into
</I>&gt;<i> a ``.. header::`` directive, instead of a reST comment (as per my
</I>&gt;<i> original proposal)?
</I>
This was my idea, however I changed it in the current implementation back
to a comment.

&gt;<i> If it is so, then I agree, and my own choice would be
</I>&gt;<i> ``.. admonition:: Colophon`` for the following reasons:
</I>
I could imagine using a class data attribute to store the &quot;header_string&quot;
so this could become customizable (at least if pylit is used from Python).


Anyway. Try the new 0.2.3 version of pylit to see whether it works as
expected. I have uploaded it to the SVN__
Additional documentation and examples are available in the tutorial__ and
the test__
