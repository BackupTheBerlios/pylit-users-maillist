Subject: [pylit] a different structure for the code and for the article?
Message-ID: <AANLkTilaXY48_XNTBisZX723Zo_w2PeB9V7Ufg68iAQK@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Discovering the features of Pylit, I ran into three questions. Someone
might be able to offer a solution or a work around:

1. I have a code with glue/boilerplate function and I wish they would
not appear in the article. I would like the article to only show a
subset of the classes and function present in the code. Is it possible
(especially considering the "dual source" choice and the round trip
conversion)?

2. Can Pylit re-use function docstrings which are already formatted as
restructured text or docstrings are always presented verbatim?

3. I have a functional code with three functions: two are primitives
to be used by the third function. This structure does not appear in
the code (they are all module functions), but I wish the function
would appear in a numbered list in the article. Is it actually
possible to have a structure of the article a bit different than the
code structure?

In the source code :
"""
# 1. function one
#    ::

deps       = lambda :1+1

#    More information on function 1

# 2. function two
#    ::

are_before = lambda : 2*3

# Now the higher level function, built on the previous primitives:

search     = lambda : deps(),are_before()
"""

I can not make this code generate the correct restructured text
source, which would be

"""
1. function one
___::

_____deps = lambda :1+1

___More information on function 1

2. function two
___::

_____are_before = lambda : 2*3

___Now the higher level function, built on the previous primitives:

search     = lambda : deps(),are_before()
"""

Thank you in advance,
